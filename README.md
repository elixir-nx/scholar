Traditional machine learning tools built on top of Nx. Scholar implements
several algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality
reduction, metrics, and preprocessing.

For deep learning, see [Axon](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon).
For decision trees/forests, see [EXGBoost](https://github.com/acalejos/exgboost).

## Installation

### Mix projects

Add to your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:scholar, "~> 0.2.1"}
  ]
end
```

Besides Scholar, you will most likely want to use an existing Nx compiler/backend,
such as EXLA:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:scholar, "~> 0.2.1"},
    {:exla, ">= 0.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

And then in your `config/config.exs` file:

```elixir
import Config
config :nx, :default_backend, EXLA.Backend
# Client can also be set to :cuda / :rocm
config :nx, :default_defn_options, [compiler: EXLA, client: :host]
```

> #### JIT required! {: .warning}
>
> It is important you set the `default_defn_options` as shown in the snippet above,
> as many algorithms in Scholar use loops which are much more memory efficient when
> JIT compiled.
>
> If for some reason you cannot set a default `defn` compiler, you can explicitly
> JIT any function, for example: `EXLA.jit(&Scholar.Cluster.AffinityPropagation.fit/1)`.

### Notebooks

To use Scholar inside code notebooks, run:

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:scholar, "~> 0.2.1"},
  {:exla, ">= 0.0.0"}
])

Nx.global_default_backend(EXLA.Backend)
# Client can also be set to :cuda / :rocm
Nx.Defn.global_default_options(compiler: EXLA, client: :host)
```

> #### JIT required! {: .warning}
>
> It is important you set the `Nx.Defn.global_default_options/1` as shown in the snippet
> above, as many algorithms in Scholar use loops which are much more memory efficient
> when JIT compiled.
>
> If for some reason you cannot set a default `defn` compiler, you can explicitly
> JIT any function, for example: `EXLA.jit(&Scholar.Cluster.AffinityPropagation.fit/1)`.
