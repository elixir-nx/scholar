defmodule Scholar.Neighbors.LargeVis do
  @moduledoc """
  LargeVis algorithm for approximate k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graph construction.

  The algorithms works in the following way. First, the approximate k-NN graph is constructed
  using a random projection forest. Then, the graph is refined by looking at the neighbors of
  neighbors of every point for a fixed number of iterations. This step is called NN-expansion.
