  Calculates Jaccard similarity (also known as Jaccard similarity coefficient, or Jaccard index).

  Jaccard similarity is a statistic used to measure similarities between two sets. Mathematically, the calculation
  of Jaccard similarity is the ratio of set intersection over set union.

  $$
  J(A, B) = \frac{\mid A \cap B \mid}{\mid A \cup B \mid}
  $$

  Calculates Jaccard similarity based on binary attributes.

  $$
  J = \frac{M_{11}}{M_{01} + M_{10} + M_{11}}
  $$

  $M_{11}$ is the total numbers of attributes, for which both X and Y have 1.\
  $M_{10}$ is the total numbers of attributes, for which X has 1 and Y has 0.\
  $M_{01}$ is the total numbers of attributes, for which X has 0 and Y has 1.\
  $M_{00}$ is the total numbers of attributes, for which both X and Y have 0.
